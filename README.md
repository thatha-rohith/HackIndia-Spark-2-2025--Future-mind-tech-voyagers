# 🗳️ Decentralized Voting DApp

## 🌟 Overview
The **Decentralized Voting DApp** is a blockchain-based voting system designed to provide a **secure, transparent, and tamper-proof** election process. Built using **Ethereum smart contracts**, this application ensures that votes are **immutable and verifiable**, eliminating the risks of fraud and centralized manipulation.

---

## 🔥 Key Features
✅ **Blockchain Security** - Every vote is recorded on the Ethereum blockchain, ensuring transparency and integrity.

✅ **Smart Contract-Based Voting** - Uses Hardhat for smart contract development and deployment.

✅ **User-Friendly Interface** - Developed with Next.js for a seamless user experience.

✅ **Decentralized System** - No single authority can manipulate the votes, ensuring a fair election.

✅ **Candidate Registration** - Allows administrators to register candidates securely.

✅ **Real-Time Vote Counting** - The blockchain automatically updates and displays voting results.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ **Candidate Registration** - Admins register candidates via the smart contract.  
2️⃣ **User Authentication** - Voters authenticate using their Ethereum wallets (e.g., MetaMask).  
3️⃣ **Voting Process** - Users cast their votes through the DApp interface.  
4️⃣ **Blockchain Storage** - Votes are securely stored on the Ethereum blockchain.  
5️⃣ **Result Display** - Votes are counted automatically, and results are displayed in real-time.
